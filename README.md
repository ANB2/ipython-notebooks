A collection of iPython notebooks. Most are work in progress. Here are some that are reasonably complete.

- [Benchmarks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/master/Benchmarks.ipynb)
- [Elections](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/master/Elections.ipynb)
- [Marks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/master/Marks.ipynb)
- [NYPD Crash Data](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/master/NYPD-Crash.ipynb)
- [Office: PowerPoint via Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/master/Office.ipynb)

The quickest way to set these up is via [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html). The downloads are ~300MB, though.
