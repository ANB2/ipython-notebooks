A collection of iPython notebooks. Most are work in progress. Here are some that are done.

- [Elections](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/master/Elections.ipynb)
- [Marks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/master/Marks.ipynb)
- [Range search](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/master/Range-search.ipynb)
- [NYPD Crash Data](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/master/NYPD-Crash.ipynb)

The quickest way to set these up is via [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html). The downloads are ~200MB, though.
